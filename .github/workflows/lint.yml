# Purpose: Comprehensive code quality and linting workflow with Docker-based execution and caching
# Scope: Complete linting coverage for Python, TypeScript, React, and custom design pattern validation
# Overview: Executes comprehensive code quality checks across all codebase components using Docker
#     containerization for consistent linting environments. Implements advanced Docker BuildKit caching
#     to optimize performance, runs multiple linting tools including Ruff, ESLint, custom SOLID principle
#     validators, and design pattern linters. Provides detailed linting summaries and integrates with
#     CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality standards before merging changes.
# Dependencies: Docker BuildKit, make targets, linting tools (Ruff, ESLint, MyPy, custom linters)
# Exports: Linting execution status, code quality reports, and comprehensive quality summaries
# Environment: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with Docker layer caching and quality gate enforcement
# Related: Links to linting configuration, Docker setup, and code quality standards documentation
# Implementation: Uses GitHub Actions with Docker BuildKit caching and make-based linting orchestration
