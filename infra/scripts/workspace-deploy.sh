# Purpose: Unified deployment script for Terraform workspaces
# Scope: Handle deployment of base, runtime, or all infrastructure based on SCOPE parameter
# Overview: This script orchestrates Terraform deployments across workspace-separated infrastructure.
#     It ensures proper deployment order (base before runtime) and handles both individual
#     workspace deployments and full infrastructure deployment. The script delegates to
#     specific workspace deployment scripts for actual Terraform operations.
# Dependencies: workspace-deploy-base.sh, workspace-deploy-runtime.sh
# Usage: ./workspace-deploy.sh <env> <scope>
#   env: dev|staging|prod
#   scope: base|runtime|all
