# Purpose: Destroy runtime infrastructure workspace containing ephemeral resources
# Scope: Manages destruction of ECS cluster, services, task definitions, ALB listeners via Terraform
# Overview: This script automates the destruction of runtime infrastructure resources that can be
#     safely removed without affecting base infrastructure. It handles workspace selection and
#     executes terraform destroy for the runtime workspace. The script includes safety prompts
#     and provides colored output for better visibility. Runtime resources include ECS services,
#     task definitions, ALB target groups and listeners, CloudWatch logs, and IAM roles.
# Dependencies: Terraform, AWS credentials, initialized runtime workspace
# Usage: ./workspace-destroy-runtime.sh [dev|staging|prod]
# Environment: Requires AWS credentials and proper IAM permissions for resource deletion
# Configuration: Uses backend-config/runtime-{env}.hcl and environments/{env}.tfvars
# Error Handling: Exits on any error with proper error messages
