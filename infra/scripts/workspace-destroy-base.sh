# Purpose: Destroy base infrastructure workspace containing persistent resources
# Scope: Manages destruction of VPC, NAT, ECR, Route53, ACM, ALB base resources via Terraform
# Overview: This script automates the destruction of base infrastructure resources. It should
#     only be called when completely tearing down an environment, as these resources are
#     expensive to recreate and may have dependencies. The script includes multiple safety
#     checks and requires explicit confirmation. Base resources include VPC, subnets, NAT
#     gateways, Internet Gateway, ECR repositories, Route53 zones, ACM certificates, and
#     the Application Load Balancer itself.
# Dependencies: Terraform, AWS credentials, initialized base workspace
# Usage: ./workspace-destroy-base.sh [dev|staging|prod]
# Environment: Requires AWS credentials and proper IAM permissions for resource deletion
# Configuration: Uses backend-config/base-{env}.hcl and environments/{env}.tfvars
# Warning: This is a destructive operation that removes critical infrastructure
