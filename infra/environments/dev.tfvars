# Purpose: Development environment configuration with aggressive cost optimization settings
# Scope: Variable overrides specific to the development environment for infrastructure deployment
# Overview: This file provides environment-specific variable values for the development
#     infrastructure, prioritizing cost savings over performance and availability. Key
#     cost optimizations include Fargate Spot instances (70% cost reduction), auto-shutdown
#     scheduling (66% compute cost savings), minimal resource sizing (256 CPU/512 Memory),
#     and scale-to-zero capabilities during off-hours. All optional security features like
#     WAF, GuardDuty, and enhanced monitoring are disabled to minimize costs. The configuration
#     targets a monthly budget of $10 or less while maintaining a functional development
#     environment for testing and iteration. Auto-shutdown schedules ensure resources only
#     run during business hours on weekdays, with complete shutdown on weekends for maximum
#     cost efficiency.
# Dependencies: Requires variables defined in terraform/variables.tf and backend configuration
# Exports: Environment-specific variable overrides for development infrastructure deployment
# Configuration: Applied via terraform plan/apply -var-file=../environments/dev.tfvars
# Environment: Development environment with cost-optimized settings and aggressive resource scheduling
# Related: Links to staging.tfvars and prod.tfvars for environment comparison
# Implementation: Uses Fargate Spot, auto-shutdown scheduling, and minimal resource allocation for cost optimization
