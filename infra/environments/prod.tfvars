# Purpose: Production environment configuration with reliability and security focus
# Scope: Variable overrides specific to the production environment
# Overview: This file provides environment-specific variable values for the production
#     infrastructure, prioritizing reliability, security, and performance while maintaining
#     cost efficiency where possible. Uses on-demand Fargate instances for maximum
#     reliability with no auto-shutdown to ensure 24/7 availability. Resources are sized
#     for production workloads (512 CPU/1024 Memory) with a minimum of two instances for
#     high availability. All security features are enabled including WAF, GuardDuty, and
#     Security Hub for comprehensive threat detection and compliance monitoring. Full
#     Container Insights provides detailed monitoring and alerting. The configuration
#     targets a monthly budget of $25 while ensuring production-grade reliability,
#     security, and performance for end users.
# Dependencies: Requires variables defined in terraform/variables.tf
# Configuration: Applied via terraform plan/apply -var-file=../environments/prod.tfvars
