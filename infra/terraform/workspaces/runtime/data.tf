# Purpose: Data source definitions for cross-workspace resource references from base infrastructure
# Scope: Lookup of VPC, subnets, security groups, ECR repositories, ALB, and Route53 resources from base workspace
# Overview: This file contains data source definitions that enable the runtime workspace to reference
#     resources created and managed by the base infrastructure workspace. Instead of direct resource
#     references, the runtime workspace uses tag-based and name-based lookups to discover base
#     resources dynamically. This approach provides loose coupling between workspaces while
#     maintaining operational integrity. Data sources use consistent tagging strategies and naming
#     conventions established in the base workspace to ensure reliable resource discovery across
#     environments. The file includes comprehensive lookups for networking, security, container
#     registry, load balancer, and DNS resources required by runtime services.
# Dependencies: Base workspace must be deployed first with properly tagged resources
# Exports: Data source references for use throughout runtime workspace configuration
# Configuration: Uses environment-aware tags and naming patterns for resource discovery
# Environment: Filters resources based on local.environment from workspace name
# Related: Base workspace outputs.tf for available resources, ecs.tf and alb-listeners.tf for usage
# Implementation: Tag-based filtering with fallback to name-based lookups where appropriate
