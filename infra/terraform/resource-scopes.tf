# Purpose: Define resource scopes for base vs runtime infrastructure separation
# Scope: Controls which resources are deployed/destroyed based on SCOPE parameter
# Overview: This file defines tags and metadata to separate persistent base resources
#     from ephemeral runtime resources. Base resources include VPC, NAT, ECR, Route53
#     which are expensive to recreate. Runtime resources include ECS, ALB listeners
#     which can be quickly recreated for cost savings.
