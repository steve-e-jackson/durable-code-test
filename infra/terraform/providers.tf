# Purpose: Define AWS provider configuration with default tags and multi-region support
# Scope: AWS provider settings for all Terraform resources across environments
# Overview: This file configures the AWS provider with appropriate settings for deploying
#     infrastructure across multiple regions. It establishes default resource tagging for
#     cost tracking, compliance, and resource management. The configuration includes both
#     the primary provider for the main region and an aliased provider for us-east-1
#     (required for CloudFront certificates). Default tags ensure all resources are
#     properly labeled for cost allocation, project tracking, and automated management.
#     The provider configuration supports role assumption for cross-account deployments.
# Dependencies: AWS credentials configured via AWS CLI or environment variables
# Configuration: Uses variables from variables.tf for region and project settings
# Exports: Primary AWS provider and us-east-1 aliased provider for ACM certificates

  region = var.aws_region
