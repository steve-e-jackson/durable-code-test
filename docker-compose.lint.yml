# Purpose: Docker Compose configuration for dedicated linting containers
# Scope: Orchestrates Python and JavaScript linting services with proper volume mounting
# Overview: Defines linting services that mount source code directories for analysis
#     without including application runtime. Services are configured for manual execution
#     via make targets, with proper networking isolation and resource constraints.
#     Volume mounts provide access to backend, frontend, tools, and test directories.
# Dependencies: Dedicated linting Dockerfiles, source code directories
# Exports: Named linting services (python-linter, js-linter)
# Interfaces: Volume mounts to source directories, network isolation
# Implementation: Service-per-linting-type with shared source volume strategy
