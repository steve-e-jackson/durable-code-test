### Lambda Functions for Scheduling
```python
# stop_ecs_services.py
import boto3
import os

def handler(event, context):
    ecs = boto3.client('ecs')
    cluster = os.environ['CLUSTER_NAME']
    services = os.environ['SERVICE_NAMES'].split(',')

    for service in services:
        # Check for override tag
        response = ecs.describe_services(
            cluster=cluster,
            services=[service]
        )

        tags = ecs.list_tags_for_resource(
            resourceArn=response['services'][0]['serviceArn']
        )

        if 'keep-running' not in [tag['key'] for tag in tags.get('tags', [])]:
            ecs.update_service(
                cluster=cluster,
                service=service,
                desiredCount=0
            )

    return {'statusCode': 200}
```

### EventBridge Schedule Rules
```hcl
# Weekday shutdown - 8 PM PST (4 AM UTC)
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "shutdown_weekday" {
  name                = "ecs-shutdown-weekday"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 4 ? * TUE-FRI *)"
}

# Weekday startup - 8 AM PST (4 PM UTC)
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "startup_weekday" {
  name                = "ecs-startup-weekday"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 16 ? * MON-FRI *)"
}

# Weekend shutdown - Friday 8 PM PST
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "shutdown_weekend" {
  name                = "ecs-shutdown-weekend"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 4 ? * SAT *)"
}
```

### Cost Breakdown with Optimization
**Before optimization (24/7 operation)**:
- Fargate: ~$30/month
- ALB: ~$18/month
- Route53: ~$1/month
- CloudWatch/ECR: ~$5/month
- **Total: ~$54/month**

**After optimization (12 hours weekday + shutdown weekends)**:
- Fargate: ~$10/month (66% reduction)
- ALB: ~$18/month (always on)
- Route53: ~$1/month
- CloudWatch/ECR: ~$3/month
- **Total: ~$32/month (40% savings)**

**With Fargate Spot for dev**:
- Additional 70% savings on dev environment
- **Total: ~$25/month (54% total savings)**

### Blockers
