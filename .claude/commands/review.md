# Code Review Command

## Purpose
Perform a comprehensive, multi-agent code review of the codebase using specialized AI reviewers working in parallel. This command provides rigorous, constructive feedback focused on code quality, architecture, performance, and best practices.

## Command Overview
The `/review` command deploys specialized AI agents to conduct thorough code reviews with configurable depth and scope:

**Arguments:**
- **Depth** (optional): `light` (quick scan), `medium` (default, balanced), or `heavy` (exhaustive)
- **Scope** (optional): `frontend`, `backend`, or `all` (default)

**Examples:**
```bash
/review                          # Medium depth, all code
/review light                    # Quick review of all code
/review heavy frontend           # Exhaustive frontend review
/review medium backend           # Balanced backend review
```

## Review Process Flow

### 1. Scope Determination
```bash
# Determine files to review based on arguments
if scope == "frontend":
    files = frontend_files
elif scope == "backend":
    files = backend_files
else:
    files = all_files

# Apply depth-based filtering
if depth == "light":
    focus_on_critical_files()
elif depth == "heavy":
    include_all_files_and_configs()
```

### 2. Parallel Agent Deployment
Launch all 5 agents simultaneously with scope-specific prompts:
```
ðŸš€ Deploying Review Agents:
  âœ“ Frontend Specialist â†’ React, TypeScript, CSS
  âœ“ Backend Reviewer â†’ API, Database, Services
  âœ“ DevOps Analyst â†’ Docker, CI/CD, Config
  âœ“ Quality Auditor â†’ Tests, Docs, Standards
  âœ“ Security Expert â†’ Performance, Vulnerabilities
```

### 3. Agent Review Execution
Each agent performs its specialized review:
- Analyzes assigned files
- Identifies issues by severity
- Provides specific recommendations
- Generates code examples for fixes
- Returns structured findings

### 4. Review Consolidation
Combine all agent reports into unified feedback:
- Deduplicate overlapping findings
- Prioritize by severity and impact
- Group related issues together
- Generate actionable recommendations

### 5. Report Generation
Create comprehensive review report with:
- Executive summary
- Prioritized issues list
- Code examples and fixes
- Positive patterns to maintain
- Improvement roadmap

## Review Output Format

### Executive Summary
```markdown
# Code Review Report

   - Issue: Effect cleanup missing for WebSocket subscription
   - Fix: Add cleanup function to useEffect
   ```typescript
   // Current (problematic)
   useEffect(() => {
     socket.subscribe('products', handleUpdate);
   }, []);

   // Recommended
   useEffect(() => {
