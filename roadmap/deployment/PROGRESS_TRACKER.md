## PR4.6: Fix Terraform Targeting - Implement Proper Conditional Resource Creation
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started | **Completion**: 0% | **Cost**: No additional cost

### Problem Statement
The current PR4.5 implementation uses `-target` flags for selective resource deployment, which:
- Terraform explicitly warns against for routine operations
- Breaks dependency graph management
- Can cause state inconsistencies
- Is only intended for error recovery scenarios

### Solution Approach
Replace `-target` flag usage with Terraform's native conditional resource creation using `count` or `for_each`.

### Checklist
- [ ] Analyze all resources for scope dependencies
- [ ] Implement conditional creation logic using `count` based on `deployment_scope`
- [ ] Update all resource definitions to support conditional creation
- [ ] Test base-only deployment (VPC, NAT, ECR, Route53)
- [ ] Test runtime-only deployment (ECS, ALB listeners, services)
- [ ] Test full deployment (all resources)
- [ ] Remove `-target` flag generation from `generate-targets.sh`
- [ ] Update Makefile to pass `deployment_scope` without targets
- [ ] Verify no resources are orphaned or duplicated
- [ ] Update documentation with new deployment approach
- [ ] PR created and reviewed
- [ ] Merged to main

### Implementation Details

#### Resource Conditionals Pattern
```hcl
# Example for runtime resources
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  count = var.deployment_scope == "base" ? 0 : 1
  name  = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-cluster"
  # ... rest of configuration
}

# Example for base resources
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  count = var.deployment_scope == "runtime" ? 0 : 1
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  # ... rest of configuration
}

# Resources that should always exist
resource "aws_route53_zone" "main" {
  count = var.deployment_scope != "none" ? 1 : 0  # Always created unless explicitly disabled
  name  = var.domain_name
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

#### Updated Makefile Approach
```makefile
# No more TARGETS variable or generate-targets.sh needed
infra-up:
	terraform apply -var="deployment_scope=$(SCOPE)" -auto-approve
```

### Benefits
- **Terraform native approach** - No warnings or state issues
- **Proper dependency management** - Terraform handles all relationships
- **Cleaner implementation** - No external script needed
- **Better state consistency** - Single source of truth
- **Easier maintenance** - All logic in Terraform files

### Migration Strategy
1. Start with non-critical resources (CloudWatch logs, etc.)
2. Test each scope thoroughly before moving to next resource type
3. Keep backward compatibility during transition
4. Remove old targeting system only after full validation

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] `make infra-up SCOPE=base` - Only creates VPC, NAT, ECR, Route53
- [ ] `make infra-up SCOPE=runtime` - Only creates ECS, services, listeners
- [ ] `make infra-up SCOPE=all` - Creates everything
- [ ] `make infra-down SCOPE=runtime` - Only destroys runtime resources
- [ ] `make infra-down SCOPE=base` - Only destroys base resources
- [ ] `make infra-down SCOPE=all` - Destroys everything

### Notes
- This fixes the architectural flaw in PR4.5
- Aligns with Terraform best practices
- Enables true selective deployment without warnings
- Foundation for future multi-environment deployments

import boto3
import os

def handler(event, context):
    ecs = boto3.client('ecs')
    cluster = os.environ['CLUSTER_NAME']
    services = os.environ['SERVICE_NAMES'].split(',')

    for service in services:
        # Check for override tag
        response = ecs.describe_services(
            cluster=cluster,
            services=[service]
        )

        tags = ecs.list_tags_for_resource(
            resourceArn=response['services'][0]['serviceArn']
        )

        if 'keep-running' not in [tag['key'] for tag in tags.get('tags', [])]:
            ecs.update_service(
                cluster=cluster,
                service=service,
                desiredCount=0
            )

    return {'statusCode': 200}
```

### EventBridge Schedule Rules
```hcl
# Weekday shutdown - 8 PM PST (4 AM UTC)
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "shutdown_weekday" {
  name                = "ecs-shutdown-weekday"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 4 ? * TUE-FRI *)"
}

# Weekday startup - 8 AM PST (4 PM UTC)
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "startup_weekday" {
  name                = "ecs-startup-weekday"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 16 ? * MON-FRI *)"
}

# Weekend shutdown - Friday 8 PM PST
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "shutdown_weekend" {
  name                = "ecs-shutdown-weekend"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 4 ? * SAT *)"
}
```

### Cost Breakdown with Optimization
**Before optimization (24/7 operation)**:
- Fargate: ~$30/month
- ALB: ~$18/month
- Route53: ~$1/month
- CloudWatch/ECR: ~$5/month
- **Total: ~$54/month**

**After optimization (12 hours weekday + shutdown weekends)**:
- Fargate: ~$10/month (66% reduction)
- ALB: ~$18/month (always on)
- Route53: ~$1/month
- CloudWatch/ECR: ~$3/month
- **Total: ~$32/month (40% savings)**

**With Fargate Spot for dev**:
- Additional 70% savings on dev environment
- **Total: ~$25/month (54% total savings)**

### Blockers

## 📋 AI Agent Instructions for Next PR

### When Starting Work on Next PR:

1. **Read Documents in This Order**:
   ```
   1. PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (this file) - Check "Next PR to Implement"
   2. AI_CONTEXT.md - For AWS architecture context
   3. PR_BREAKDOWN.md - Find your PR section for detailed steps
   ```

2. **Cost Optimization Priority**:
   - Always consider cost impact of every decision
   - Target: Keep monthly costs under $25 with scheduling
   - Use Fargate Spot for non-production
   - Implement auto-shutdown scheduling early (PR8)

3. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/pr[N]-description
   ```

4. **Verify Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   # Check AWS CLI configuration
   aws sts get-caller-identity

   # Verify Terraform installation
   terraform version

   # Check domain availability (for PR0)
   aws route53domains check-domain-availability --domain-name codewithai.dev
   ```

5. **Implement PR Following Best Practices**:
   - Use consistent resource naming: `durable-code-{resource}`
   - Tag all resources with: Project, Environment, CostCenter
   - Document all manual steps
   - Keep infrastructure code DRY with modules
   - Always run `terraform plan` before `apply`

6. **Cost Monitoring During Implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Check current month costs
   aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
     --time-period Start=2025-01-01,End=2025-01-31 \
     --granularity MONTHLY \
     --metrics "UnblendedCost" \
     --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
   ```

7. **Before Completing PR**:
   ```bash
   terraform fmt         # Format code
   terraform validate    # Validate syntax
   terraform plan        # Review changes
   # Document actual costs in this tracker
   ```

8. **Update This Document**:
   - Update "📍 Current Status" section
   - Mark PR as completed in dashboard
   - Update "Next PR to Implement" section
   - Add actual costs to metrics
   - Document any cost-saving discoveries
   - Note any deviations from plan

9. **Update AWS Deployment Case Study in Planning Tab**:
   - **IMPORTANT**: Near PR completion, update http://localhost:5173/#Planning
   - Navigate to the "AWS Deployment Case Study" section
   - Update the deployment progress percentage
   - **Document lessons learned for future projects**:
     - What planning approaches worked well
     - Actual vs estimated costs and why they differed
     - Unexpected challenges and solutions
     - Successful cost optimization strategies
   - Create a knowledge base for future AWS deployments
   - This documents successful planning patterns for others to learn from
