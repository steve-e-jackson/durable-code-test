# Deployment Checklist for CI/CD

## Pre-Deployment Validation ✅

### Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] All linting passes (ESLint, Ruff, etc.)
- [ ] Unit tests pass including WebSocket service tests
- [ ] Integration tests validate API endpoints
- [ ] No hardcoded backend ports in production builds

### Docker Build Preparation
- [ ] `.dockerignore` updated to exclude cache directories (`.ruff_cache`, `node_modules`)
- [ ] Build context is clean (no permission issues)
- [ ] Docker images build successfully from clean directories
- [ ] Image tags use versioning (avoid overwriting `latest`)

## Deployment Process 🚀

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] AWS credentials configured (`AWS_PROFILE=terraform-deploy`)
- [ ] Terraform backend accessible
- [ ] ECR repositories exist and accessible

### 2. Build and Push Images
- [ ] Build frontend image with clean context
- [ ] Build backend image with clean context
- [ ] Tag images with version numbers (e.g., `v4`, `v5`)
- [ ] Push images to ECR successfully
- [ ] Verify images exist in ECR console

### 3. Infrastructure Updates
- [ ] Update `ecs.tf` with new image tags
- [ ] Verify ALB routing includes all required endpoints
- [ ] Check ALB path patterns don't exceed 5 per condition
- [ ] Apply Terraform changes to task definitions and services

### 4. Service Deployment
```bash
# Update ECS services
terraform apply -var="environment=dev" -var="deployment_scope=runtime" \
  -target=aws_ecs_task_definition.frontend \
  -target=aws_ecs_task_definition.backend \
  -target=aws_ecs_service.frontend \
  -target=aws_ecs_service.backend \
  -auto-approve
```

## Post-Deployment Validation ✅

### Health Checks
- [ ] ECS services show running tasks
- [ ] ALB target groups show healthy targets
- [ ] Container health checks pass
- [ ] Service discovery DNS resolves correctly

### API Validation
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `GET /health`
- [ ] API endpoints accessible: `GET /api/oscilloscope/config`
- [ ] WebSocket connections work (correct URL without port)
- [ ] All application features functional

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Response times within acceptable limits
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] No errors in CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Resource utilization within expected ranges

## Troubleshooting Commands 🔧

```bash
# Check ECS service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster durableai-dev-cluster --services durable-code-dev-frontend durable-code-dev-backend

# View container logs
aws logs tail /ecs/durable-code-dev/frontend --follow
aws logs tail /ecs/durable-code-dev/backend --follow

# Test ALB endpoints
curl -s "http://durable-code-dev-alb-1541042360.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/health"
curl -s "http://durable-code-dev-alb-1541042360.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/api/oscilloscope/config"

# Check ALB target health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:449870229058:targetgroup/durable-code-dev-frontend-tg/85a05d3d7b03cb76
```

## Rollback Procedures 🔄

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Revert Terraform Configuration**
   - Change image tags back to previous working version
   - Apply Terraform changes to roll back

2. **Quick Health Check**
   ```bash
   # Verify rollback succeeded
   curl -s "http://durable-code-dev-alb-1541042360.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/health"
   ```

3. **Investigation**
   - Check CloudWatch logs for errors
   - Verify service discovery configuration
   - Check security group rules
   - Validate WebSocket URL generation

## Common Issues and Solutions 🛠️

### WebSocket Connection Failures
- **Symptom**: Frontend can't connect to WebSocket
- **Check**: WebSocket URL generation (should omit port for ALB)
- **Fix**: Ensure production builds use ALB hostname without `:8000`

### Service Discovery Issues
- **Symptom**: Services can't resolve each other
- **Check**: DNS resolution within containers
- **Fix**: Verify services registered in correct namespace (`dev.local`)

### ALB Routing Problems
- **Symptom**: API endpoints return 404
- **Check**: ALB listener rules include required path patterns
- **Fix**: Add missing patterns, ensure under 5 patterns per condition

### Container Health Check Failures
- **Symptom**: Tasks fail to start or become unhealthy
- **Check**: Health check endpoints and container startup
- **Fix**: Verify health check paths and container port configuration

## Environment-Specific Notes 📋

### Development Environment
- Uses Fargate Spot for cost savings
- Minimal resource allocation
- Relaxed health check intervals
- 7-day log retention

### Production Environment (Future)
- Uses standard Fargate for reliability
- Higher resource allocation
- Strict health check intervals
- 30-day log retention
- Auto-scaling enabled
- SSL/TLS termination

## Success Criteria ✨

Deployment is successful when:
- ✅ All services show healthy in ECS console
- ✅ ALB target groups show healthy targets
- ✅ Frontend loads successfully in browser
- ✅ Oscilloscope WebSocket connects and streams data
- ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ No errors in CloudWatch logs
- ✅ Application performance meets baseline

## Documentation Updates 📝

After successful deployment:
- [ ] Update deployment version in documentation
- [ ] Record any new lessons learned
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guides if needed
- [ ] Document any configuration changes made
