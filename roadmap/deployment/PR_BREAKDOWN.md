## PR1: Terraform Foundation and AWS Provider Setup

### Context
Establish the Terraform infrastructure foundation with AWS provider configuration, state management, and basic networking setup. This PR creates the groundwork for all subsequent infrastructure.

### Files to Create/Modify
```
infra/
├── terraform/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   ├── outputs.tf
│   └── networking.tf
├── environments/
│   ├── dev.tfvars
│   └── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Set up Terraform backend for state management**
   ```hcl
   # main.tf
   terraform {
     required_version = ">= 1.0"
     backend "s3" {
       bucket = "durable-code-terraform-state"
       key    = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
       region = "us-west-2"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Provider**
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = var.aws_region
     default_tags {
       tags = {
         Project     = "durable-code-test"
         Environment = var.environment
         ManagedBy   = "terraform"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create VPC and networking resources**
   - VPC with public/private subnets
   - Internet Gateway
   - NAT Gateway for private subnets
   - Security groups for ALB and ECS

### Testing
- Run `terraform init` successfully
- Run `terraform plan` with no errors
- Validate VPC creation in AWS Console

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Terraform state backend configured
- [ ] VPC and subnets created
- [ ] Security groups defined
- [ ] All resources properly tagged

## PR2: ECR Repositories and Container Registry Setup

### Context
Create Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories for storing Docker images. Set up lifecycle policies to manage image retention and reduce storage costs.

### Files to Create/Modify
```
infra/terraform/
├── ecr.tf
└── variables.tf (update)
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create ECR repositories**
   ```hcl

   resource "aws_ecr_repository" "backend" {
     name = "${var.project_name}-backend"
     image_scanning_configuration {
       scan_on_push = true
     }
   }

   resource "aws_ecr_repository" "frontend" {
     name = "${var.project_name}-frontend"
     image_scanning_configuration {
       scan_on_push = true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add lifecycle policies**
   - Keep last 10 images
   - Remove untagged images after 7 days

3. **Create push/pull policies**
   - Allow GitHub Actions to push
   - Allow ECS to pull

### Testing

### Files to Create/Modify
```
infra/terraform/
├── alb.tf
├── route53.tf
└── acm.tf
```

### Implementation Steps

## PR4.5: Dual-Architecture Terraform Refactor (Base/Runtime Separation)

### Context
Refactor Terraform into a dual-architecture approach to solve the 30+ minute certificate validation delays discovered in PR4. Separate persistent "base" resources (certificates, Route53 zones) from ephemeral "runtime" resources (ALB, ECS, NAT Gateway) to enable fast infrastructure recovery (<5 minutes) while avoiding lengthy certificate re-validation.

### Problem Being Solved
- ACM certificate DNS validation takes 30+ minutes
- Full infrastructure destroy/create cycles are painful for developers
- Need ability to quickly tear down expensive resources while preserving slow-to-provision ones

### Files to Create/Modify
```
infra/
├── terraform-base/           # Persistent resources (rarely destroyed)
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   ├── outputs.tf
│   ├── acm.tf              # Move from terraform/
│   ├── route53.tf          # Move from terraform/
│   └── ecr.tf              # Move from terraform/
├── terraform-runtime/       # Ephemeral resources (frequently cycled)
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   ├── data.tf            # Reference base outputs
│   ├── alb.tf             # Move from terraform/
│   ├── ecs.tf             # Keep in runtime
│   └── networking.tf      # NAT Gateway, etc.
└── Makefile               # Update with new paths
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Split resources by provisioning time and cost**:
   - Base (keep): ACM certs, Route53 zones, ECR repos, VPC, subnets
   - Runtime (cycle): NAT Gateway, ALB, ECS services, tasks

2. **Create data sources in runtime to reference base**:
   ```hcl
   # terraform-runtime/data.tf
   data "terraform_remote_state" "base" {
     backend = "s3"
     config = {
       bucket = "durable-code-terraform-state"
       key    = "infrastructure/base/terraform.tfstate"
       region = "us-west-2"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update Makefile targets**:
   ```makefile
   infra-base-up:
       cd infra/terraform-base && terraform apply

   infra-runtime-up:
       cd infra/terraform-runtime && terraform apply

   infra-runtime-down:
       cd infra/terraform-runtime && terraform destroy
   ```

### Testing
- Deploy base infrastructure (should include certs)
- Deploy runtime infrastructure
- Destroy runtime only
- Redeploy runtime (should be <5 minutes)
- Verify certificate still valid

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Base resources persist through runtime cycles
- [ ] Runtime can be destroyed/created in <5 minutes
- [ ] Certificate validation not required on runtime redeploy
- [ ] Cost savings of ~$60/month from scheduled runtime teardown
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns

## PR5: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

### Context
Implement continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions with OIDC for secure, passwordless AWS authentication. Automate the build, test, and deployment process.

### Files to Create/Modify
```
.github/workflows/
├── deploy.yml
├── build-and-test.yml
infra/terraform/
├── iam.tf (update for OIDC)
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Configure GitHub OIDC Provider**
   ```hcl
   # iam.tf
   resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "github" {
     url = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
     client_id_list = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
     thumbprint_list = ["6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1"]

### Files to Create/Modify
```
infra/terraform/
├── automation.tf         # Lambda functions for scheduling
├── autoscaling.tf        # ECS auto-scaling (within operating hours)

├── start-infra.sh        # Manual start script
├── stop-infra.sh         # Manual stop script
└── scheduler.py          # Lambda function code
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create Infrastructure Scheduler**
   ```hcl
   # automation.tf
   resource "aws_lambda_function" "infra_scheduler" {
     function_name = "durableai-${var.environment}-scheduler"
     handler       = "scheduler.handler"
     runtime       = "python3.9"
     timeout       = 900

     environment {
       variables = {
         TF_STATE_BUCKET = "durableai-terraform-state"
         ENVIRONMENT     = var.environment
         PRODUCT_DOMAIN  = "durableai"
       }
     }

     tags = {
       ProductDomain = "durableai"
       Component     = "automation"
       Purpose       = "cost-optimization"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Schedule Infrastructure Start/Stop**
   ```hcl
   # Morning startup - 8 AM EST (1 PM UTC)
   resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "start_infra" {
     name                = "durableai-${var.environment}-start"
     schedule_expression = "cron(0 13 ? * MON-FRI *)"
   }

   # Evening shutdown - 8 PM EST (1 AM UTC next day)
   resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "stop_infra" {
     name                = "durableai-${var.environment}-stop"
     schedule_expression = "cron(0 1 ? * TUE-SAT *)"
   }
   ```

3. **Manual Control Scripts**
   ```bash
   # start-infra.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/terraform
   export AWS_PROFILE=terraform-deploy
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -auto-approve

   # stop-infra.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/terraform
   export AWS_PROFILE=terraform-deploy
   terraform destroy -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -auto-approve
   ```

4. **Cost Monitoring**
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_budgets_budget" "infrastructure" {
     name         = "durableai-${var.environment}-budget"
     budget_type  = "COST"
     limit_amount = var.budget_amount
     limit_unit   = "USD"
     time_unit    = "MONTHLY"
   }
   ```

### Testing
- Test Lambda function can successfully destroy/create infrastructure
- Verify schedule triggers work correctly
- Test manual override tags prevent unwanted destruction
- Validate cost savings after one week

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Infrastructure automatically starts at 8 AM weekdays
- [ ] Infrastructure automatically stops at 8 PM weekdays
- [ ] Weekend infrastructure remains destroyed
- [ ] Manual override capability works
- [ ] 85% cost reduction achieved vs 24/7 operation
- [ ] All resources properly tagged with ProductDomain="durableai"
