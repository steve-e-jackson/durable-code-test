## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **App.css is the highest priority** - It's blocking maintainability
- **WebSocket fix is critical for production** - Memory leaks are unacceptable
- **Maintain visual consistency** - No UI changes during refactoring
- **Test everything** - These are critical production fixes
- **Use existing patterns** - Follow established conventions in codebase

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't change functionality while refactoring
- Don't skip visual regression testing
- Don't ignore TypeScript strict mode
- Don't create new global styles
- Don't forget to update imports after moving CSS
