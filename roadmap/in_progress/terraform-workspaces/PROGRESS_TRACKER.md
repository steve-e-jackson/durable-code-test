- Implemented backend configurations for state separation
- Created workspace-init.sh script for initialization
- Created workspace-status.sh script for monitoring
- Updated .gitignore with workspace patterns
- Moved comprehensive documentation to .ai/howto/terraform-workspaces.md
- Updated layout.yaml with new workspace structure rules
- Successfully tested workspace initialization for base-dev and runtime-dev

  - Security groups (ALB and ECS tasks)
  - ECR repositories with lifecycle policies

  - Task definitions for frontend and backend services
  - ECS services with Fargate launch type
  - ALB target groups and listeners (HTTP/HTTPS)

### Implementation Phase - PR4 Complete (2025-09-28)
- Data sources for cross-workspace references were already implemented as part of PR3
- All data sources in runtime/data.tf are functional and properly configured
- Workspace isolation verified - runtime can reference base resources via data sources
- Note: PR5 (Makefile Integration) is needed to properly use workspace directories

### Implementation Phase - PR5 Complete (2025-09-28)
- Updated Makefile.infra to support workspace-specific directories
  - Added TERRAFORM_BASE_DIR variable and workspace path resolution
  - Modified Docker volume mounts to include backend-config directory
  - Implemented workspace-specific .terraform cache volumes
- Created parameter-driven commands with SCOPE parameter
  - infra-up/down/plan now support SCOPE=base|runtime|all
  - Added proper ordering: base before runtime for deploy, runtime before base for destroy
  - Implemented safety checks for base infrastructure destruction
- Created unified deployment and destruction scripts
  - workspace-deploy.sh handles orchestration across workspaces
  - workspace-destroy.sh ensures safe destruction with confirmations
  - workspace-destroy-runtime.sh and workspace-destroy-base.sh for specific operations
- Added infra-status command to show workspace deployment state
- Fixed backend configuration paths for Docker context
- All makefile targets successfully tested with workspace separation

## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
- ‚úÖ Base and runtime infrastructure are in separate workspaces
- ‚úÖ Each workspace has independent state
- ‚úÖ Runtime can reference base resources via data sources
- ‚úÖ Destroy operations work correctly per scope
- ‚úÖ Cost optimization goals are maintained
- ‚úÖ All makefile commands are workspace-aware
- ‚úÖ Documentation is complete

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **State Migration**: Existing infrastructure needs careful migration
   - Mitigation: Create backup, test in dev first
2. **Cross-Workspace Dependencies**: Complex reference patterns
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive data source layer
3. **Operational Complexity**: More complex than current setup
   - Mitigation: Strong documentation and automation
