## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
- ‚úÖ Base and runtime infrastructure are in separate workspaces
- ‚úÖ Each workspace has independent state
- ‚úÖ Runtime can reference base resources via data sources
- ‚úÖ Destroy operations work correctly per scope
- ‚úÖ Cost optimization goals are maintained
- ‚úÖ All makefile commands are workspace-aware
- ‚úÖ Documentation is complete

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **State Migration**: Existing infrastructure needs careful migration
   - Mitigation: Create backup, test in dev first
2. **Cross-Workspace Dependencies**: Complex reference patterns
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive data source layer
3. **Operational Complexity**: More complex than current setup
   - Mitigation: Strong documentation and automation
