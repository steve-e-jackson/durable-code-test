## 📝 Change Log

### Planning Phase
- Created initial roadmap structure
- Identified 6 PRs for complete implementation
- Defined workspace separation strategy

### Implementation Phase - PR1 Complete (2025-09-28)
- Created workspace directory structure (base/, runtime/, modules/, shared/)
- Implemented backend configurations for state separation
- Created workspace-init.sh script for initialization
- Created workspace-status.sh script for monitoring
- Updated .gitignore with workspace patterns
- Moved comprehensive documentation to .ai/howto/terraform-workspaces.md
- Updated layout.yaml with new workspace structure rules
- Successfully tested workspace initialization for base-dev and runtime-dev

### Implementation Phase - PR2 Complete (2025-09-28)
- Moved all base resources to base workspace configuration
  - VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT Gateways, route tables
  - Security groups (ALB and ECS tasks)
  - ECR repositories with lifecycle policies
  - Route53 zone and ACM certificate (conditional)
  - Application Load Balancer (without listeners)
- Created comprehensive outputs for runtime workspace consumption
- Implemented proper tagging with workspace metadata
- Created base workspace deployment script (workspace-deploy-base.sh)
- Documented base resources scope in workspace README
- Validated Terraform configuration successfully

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
- ✅ Base and runtime infrastructure are in separate workspaces
- ✅ Each workspace has independent state
- ✅ Runtime can reference base resources via data sources
- ✅ Destroy operations work correctly per scope
- ✅ Cost optimization goals are maintained
- ✅ All makefile commands are workspace-aware
- ✅ Documentation is complete

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **State Migration**: Existing infrastructure needs careful migration
   - Mitigation: Create backup, test in dev first
2. **Cross-Workspace Dependencies**: Complex reference patterns
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive data source layer
3. **Operational Complexity**: More complex than current setup
   - Mitigation: Strong documentation and automation
