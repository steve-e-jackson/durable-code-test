## Architecture Benefits

### Development Experience Improvements
- **Faster Container Startup**: 30-50% reduction in development container start time
- **Isolated Tool Updates**: Linting tool updates don't require rebuilding development environment
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can run different linting tasks simultaneously
- **Resource Efficiency**: Development containers use less memory without linting tools

### Deployment and Production Benefits
- **Smaller Production Images**: Remove linting tools from production containers completely
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer tools installed in production environments
- **Better Security**: Linting tools isolated from application runtime
- **Improved Caching**: Docker layers for linting tools separate from application code

### CI/CD Pipeline Benefits
- **Improved Caching**: Linting tools cached independently from application dependencies
- **Faster Builds**: Parallel linting execution reduces total CI time
- **Resource Optimization**: GitHub Actions can allocate resources more efficiently
- **Better Fault Isolation**: Linting failures don't affect other CI steps

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing make targets continue to work
- **Development Workflow**: No changes to day-to-day development process
- **Tool Availability**: All current linting tools remain available

- **Volume Mounting**: Source code access from multiple containers
- **Performance**: Potential overhead from additional container startup

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Thorough Testing**: Validate each step before proceeding
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep original Dockerfiles as backup
- **Documentation**: Clear troubleshooting guides for issues
- **Gradual Migration**: Implement in phases with validation

---

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
