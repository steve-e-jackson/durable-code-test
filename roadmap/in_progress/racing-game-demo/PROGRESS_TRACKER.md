# Racing Game Demo - Progress Tracker & AI Agent Handoff Document

**Purpose**: Primary AI agent handoff document for racing game demo feature with current progress tracking and implementation guidance

**Scope**: Complete feature development lifecycle from planning through implementation with AI agent coordination and progress tracking

**Overview**: Primary handoff document for AI agents working on the racing game demo feature.
    Tracks current implementation progress, provides next action guidance, and coordinates AI agent work across
    multiple pull requests. The racing game will be a cartoonish, physics-based racing game where the car follows
    the mouse cursor. Features include procedural track generation, collision physics, timing system, and reusable
    architecture following the oscilloscope demo patterns.

**Dependencies**: React frontend, Canvas API for rendering, Physics engine for realistic car behavior, existing demo infrastructure

**Exports**: Progress tracking, implementation guidance, AI agent coordination, and feature development roadmap

**Related**: AI_CONTEXT.md for feature overview, PR_BREAKDOWN.md for detailed tasks

**Implementation**: Progress-driven coordination with systematic validation, checklist management, and AI agent handoff procedures

## ✅ Prerequisites & Validation

### Before Starting Any PR
- [x] Current demo structure analyzed
- [x] Oscilloscope demo patterns understood
- [x] Roadmap structure followed
- [x] Feature branch created from main
- [x] All tests passing on main branch

### PR1 Completion Details
- [x] Navigation types updated to support sub-menus
- [x] TabNavigation component modified for dropdown functionality
- [x] Demo tab configuration updated to support multiple demos
- [x] Demo Router created for sub-navigation
- [x] Demo Selector UI implemented
- [x] Racing Game placeholder component created
- [x] All linting and tests passing

## 🎮 Feature Overview

### Core Gameplay
- **Mouse-following car**: Car follows mouse cursor position
- **Controls**: Left click = accelerate, Right click = brake
- **Physics**: Realistic sliding on corners, wall bouncing
- **Track**: Procedurally generated with curves and challenges
- **Objective**: Complete the track in minimum time

### Technical Architecture
Following oscilloscope demo patterns:
- **Feature-based structure**: All code in `features/racing` directory
- **Custom hooks**: `useRacingGame` for game state management
- **Canvas rendering**: Hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
- **Modular components**: Separate concerns (physics, rendering, controls)
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS rendering minimum
- < 100ms input latency
- < 2 second track generation
- < 50MB memory usage

### Quality Standards
- 100% TypeScript coverage
- Zero linting errors
- All tests passing
- Accessibility compliant
- Mobile responsive

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure all requirements met
2. **Create Feature Branch**: From latest main
3. **Implement PR Tasks**: Following checklist
4. **Run Tests**: Ensure all passing
5. **Update Documentation**: Including this tracker
6. **Create Pull Request**: With clear description
7. **Update Progress**: Mark PR as complete

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Key Principles
- **Reusability First**: Follow oscilloscope demo patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript, no any types
- **Component Isolation**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for smooth gameplay
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality first, then polish

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't modify main branch directly
- Don't skip pre-commit hooks
- Don't leave uncommitted code
- Don't bypass testing requirements
- Don't ignore TypeScript errors
