# AI-Powered Community Contributions - AI Context

**Purpose**: AI agent context document for implementing community contribution feature enabling AI prompt submissions and automated code generation

**Scope**: Complete community contribution feature including prompt submission, review workflow, GitHub integration, and AI-powered implementation

**Overview**: Comprehensive context document for AI agents working on the community contribution feature that enables
    community members to submit AI prompts for code generation. Covers project background, feature vision,
    target architecture, user journey, security strategy, and integration points with existing application
    features. Includes key decisions, success metrics, technical constraints, and specific guidance for AI
    agents on processing submissions and implementing approved prompts following project standards.

**Dependencies**: FastAPI backend, React frontend, GitHub API and OAuth, database for submissions, AI agents for implementation

**Exports**: AI agent guidance for feature implementation, architectural patterns, integration strategies, and development workflows

**Related**: PR_BREAKDOWN.md for implementation tasks, SECURITY_STRATEGY.md for security requirements, contribution-flow.html for workflow visualization

**Implementation**: Feature architecture with AI agent guidance, security considerations, and systematic implementation approach

## Overview
This document provides context for AI agents working on the community contribution feature for the Durable Code Test application. The feature enables community members to submit AI prompts that, when approved, can be used to generate code contributions to the project.

## Project Background
The Durable Code Test application demonstrates AI-ready development practices with a fully AI-authored codebase. By extending this concept, we're creating a unique contribution model where community members can contribute through AI prompts rather than direct code submissions, democratizing open-source contributions for non-programmers while maintaining code quality standards.

## Feature Vision
- **Democratized Contributions**: Enable anyone to contribute ideas without coding expertise
- **Quality Control**: All prompts reviewed before implementation
- **AI-Powered Implementation**: Approved prompts executed by AI agents
- **Community Credit**: Contributors recognized for their ideas
- **Learning Resource**: Examples demonstrate effective AI prompt engineering

## Current Application Context
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, tabbed interface architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with comprehensive error handling
- **AI Integration**: Custom Claude commands (/ask, /new-code, /solid, /fix)
- **Templates**: Extensive template library for code generation
- **Standards**: Strict development standards enforced through linting

## Target Architecture

### Core Components
- **Submission API**: FastAPI endpoint for prompt submissions
- **Authentication**: Lightweight GitHub OAuth + CAPTCHA fallback
- **Review Interface**: Admin dashboard for prompt moderation
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated issue creation for approved prompts
- **Frontend Form**: React component with guidelines and examples
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam and abuse

### User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User notices subtle "Contribute with AI" link in header
2. **Education**: Lands on contribution page with guidelines and examples
3. **Authentication**: Signs in with GitHub or proceeds with CAPTCHA
4. **Submission**: Fills out form with AI prompt and context
5. **Review**: Admin reviews and potentially approves prompt
6. **Implementation**: Approved prompt becomes GitHub issue
7. **Execution**: AI agent implements the approved prompt
8. **Recognition**: Contributor credited in commit and issue

### Security Strategy
- **Rate Limiting**: 3/day authenticated, 1/week anonymous
- **CAPTCHA**: Required for anonymous submissions
- **Moderation Queue**: Human review before GitHub integration
- **Reputation System**: Trusted contributors get expedited review
- **Audit Trail**: All submissions logged for security analysis

## Key Decisions Made

### Why AI Prompts Instead of Code?
- Lowers barrier to entry for contributions
- Ensures consistent code style (AI-generated)
- Teaches prompt engineering skills
- Aligns with project's AI-first philosophy
- Reduces review burden (reviewing ideas vs code)

### Why GitHub OAuth?
- Developers already have GitHub accounts
- Natural integration with issue creation
- Provides identity without managing users
- Enables contribution tracking
- Lightweight implementation

### Why Not Discord/Slack/Email?
- Web form provides structured data
- Better spam control
- Public visibility of contribution process
- Integrated with main application
- Easier to moderate and track

### Why Subtle UI Placement?
- Prevents overwhelming main user experience
- Reduces spam submissions
- Attracts genuinely interested contributors
- Maintains focus on primary application purpose

## Integration Points

### With Existing Features
- **Templates System**: Prompts reference existing templates
- **Standards Enforcement**: All generated code follows standards
- **AI Commands**: Prompts use similar patterns to /ask and /new-code
- **Testing Framework**: Generated code includes tests
- **Documentation**: Prompts can suggest documentation updates

### With GitHub
- **Issue Creation**: Via GitHub API
- **Labels**: `ai-contribution`, `pending-implementation`
- **Milestones**: Track contribution campaigns
- **Projects**: Organize related contributions
- **Discussions**: Link to community feedback

## Success Metrics
- **Submission Quality**: % of prompts approved
- **Implementation Rate**: % of approved prompts implemented
- **Contributor Retention**: Repeat contributors
- **Code Quality**: Generated code passing all checks
- **Community Growth**: New contributors per month

## Technical Constraints
- **No Complex User Management**: Keep authentication lightweight
- **Minimize Database Usage**: Store only essential data
- **Respect Rate Limits**: GitHub API has quotas
- **Fast Response Times**: Form submission < 2 seconds
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design required

## AI Agent Guidance

### When Processing Submissions
- Check prompt clarity and specificity
- Verify alignment with project standards
- Identify required templates and patterns
- Suggest improvements if needed
- Flag potential security concerns

### When Implementing Approved Prompts
- Reference this context document
- Use appropriate templates from .ai/templates/
- Follow standards from .ai/docs/
- Include comprehensive testing
- Add proper documentation

### Common Patterns
- Feature additions → Use feature templates
- Bug fixes → Reference existing patterns
- Documentation → Follow FILE_HEADER_STANDARDS
- UI components → Use React component templates
- API endpoints → Use FastAPI templates

## Risk Mitigation
- **Spam**: Rate limiting + CAPTCHA + moderation
- **Malicious Prompts**: Human review + security scanning
- **Poor Quality**: Guidelines + examples + rejection feedback
- **Overwhelm**: Start with limited rollout
- **Maintenance**: Automated where possible

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Pre-Review**: LLM validates prompts before human review
- **Prompt Templates**: Structured forms for common contributions
- **Voting System**: Community votes on prompt priority
- **Bounties**: Reward high-quality contributions
- **Learning Path**: Tutorial for prompt engineering
