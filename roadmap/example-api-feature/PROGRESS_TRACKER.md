## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (PR1)
Build core rate limiting logic with in-memory storage. This establishes the API and patterns for all subsequent work.

### Phase 2: Scale (PR2-PR3)
Add Redis for distributed counting and per-endpoint configuration for flexibility.

### Phase 3: Operations (PR4-PR5)
Build admin tools and client support for production use.

### Phase 4: Polish (PR6)
Complete documentation and comprehensive testing.

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] < 5ms latency added per request
- [ ] 100% test coverage for core logic
- [ ] Zero memory leaks
- [ ] Handles 10,000 req/sec

### Feature Metrics
- [ ] All endpoints protected
- [ ] Admin override capability
- [ ] Clear client feedback
- [ ] Redis failover works

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- This is an EXAMPLE roadmap to demonstrate the template system
- Rate limiting is critical for API security and stability
- Must not break existing API contracts
- Performance is critical - minimize latency impact

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't store everything in Redis initially
- Avoid complex algorithms that add latency
- Don't forget about distributed systems challenges
- Remember to handle edge cases (clock skew, etc.)
