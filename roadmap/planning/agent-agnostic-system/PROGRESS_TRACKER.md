- [ ] Implement `make fix-intelligent` to replace /fix
- [ ] Implement `make reconcile-ai` to replace /reconcile
- [ ] Implement `make solid-ai` to replace /solid
- [ ] Add `make help-ai` to list all agent commands
- [ ] Create structured output format for agent instructions
- [ ] Test each command with Claude
- [ ] Test with non-Claude AI tool
- [ ] Document in AGENTS.md

**Success Criteria**: All slash commands replaced with make targets that work with any AI

### PR3: Migrate Claude Settings to AGENTS.md
**Objective**: Convert .claude/settings.json to universal markdown format

- [ ] Extract permissions from settings.json
- [ ] Create "AI Permissions" section in AGENTS.md
- [ ] Document auto-allowed operations
- [ ] Document operations requiring permission
- [ ] Document forbidden operations
- [ ] Convert JSON rules to human-readable format
- [ ] Add examples for each permission category
- [ ] Test permission understanding with multiple AIs
- [ ] Archive .claude/settings.json
- [ ] Update any references to old settings

**Success Criteria**: Permissions clearly documented and understood by all AI tools

### PR4: Create Agentic Workflows
**Objective**: Build intelligent make targets for complex, multi-step tasks

- [ ] Create `make fix-intelligent` with iterative fixing
- [ ] Create `make analyze-performance` with structured output
- [ ] Create `make security-audit` for security review
- [ ] Create `make optimize-code` for improvements
- [ ] Create `make document-code` for auto-documentation
- [ ] Add progress indicators for multi-step tasks
- [ ] Include context gathering in commands
- [ ] Test workflow completion with various AIs
- [ ] Measure success rates

## 📊 Success Metrics Tracking

### Baseline (Current Claude-specific system)
- Tool compatibility: Claude only
- Commands: Proprietary slash commands
- Permissions: JSON format in .claude/
- Context usage: ~200KB for full .ai/ load

### Target (Agent-agnostic system)
- Tool compatibility: Any AI (Claude, GPT-4, Copilot, etc.)
- Commands: Universal make targets
- Permissions: Markdown in AGENTS.md
- Context usage: ~20KB for AGENTS.md + targeted .ai/ files

### Actual (To be measured)
- Tool compatibility: TBD
- Command success rate: TBD
- Permission clarity: TBD
- Context usage: TBD

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Developer/AI

1. Read this PROGRESS_TRACKER.md for current status
2. Check AI_CONTEXT.md for hybrid approach rationale
3. Review PR_BREAKDOWN.md for detailed steps
4. Start with the next incomplete PR (currently PR1)
5. Follow the checklist for that PR
6. Update this tracker upon completion

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Keep .ai/ structure, add AGENTS.md as universal entry
2. **Make Commands**: Replace slash commands with make targets
3. **Preserve Value**: Keep templates and detailed guides in .ai/
4. **Focus on Compatibility**: Ensure works with all major AI tools
5. **Incremental Migration**: Can use both systems during transition
