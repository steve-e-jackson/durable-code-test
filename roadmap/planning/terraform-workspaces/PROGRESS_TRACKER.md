## 📝 Change Log

### Planning Phase
- Created initial roadmap structure
- Identified 6 PRs for complete implementation
- Defined workspace separation strategy

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
- ✅ Base and runtime infrastructure are in separate workspaces
- ✅ Each workspace has independent state
- ✅ Runtime can reference base resources via data sources
- ✅ Destroy operations work correctly per scope
- ✅ Cost optimization goals are maintained
- ✅ All makefile commands are workspace-aware
- ✅ Documentation is complete

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **State Migration**: Existing infrastructure needs careful migration
   - Mitigation: Create backup, test in dev first
2. **Cross-Workspace Dependencies**: Complex reference patterns
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive data source layer
3. **Operational Complexity**: More complex than current setup
   - Mitigation: Strong documentation and automation
