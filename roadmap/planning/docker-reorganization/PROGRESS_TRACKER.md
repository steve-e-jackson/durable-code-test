## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach
1. **Foundation (PR1)**: Create structure without disruption
2. **Migration (PR2-3)**: Move files with backward compatibility
3. **Integration (PR4)**: Update all references and remove compatibility
4. **Finalization (PR5)**: Documentation and validation

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Use symbolic links during migration phases
- Keep old paths working until all references updated
- Test extensively before removing compatibility measures

### Risk Mitigation
- Test all Docker operations after each PR
- Maintain CI/CD pipeline functionality throughout
- Document rollback procedures for each phase
- Validate development workflow at each step

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Directory Organization**: All Docker files in logical locations
- **Path Consistency**: All references use new structure
- **Functionality**: Zero regression in Docker operations
- **CI/CD Performance**: No negative impact on pipeline speed

### Quality Metrics
- **Developer Experience**: Easier to find and manage Docker files
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns achieved
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for new structure
- **Team Onboarding**: Simplified Docker setup documentation

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- This reorganization builds on the completed Docker linting separation project
- All existing Docker functionality must be preserved throughout migration
- Backward compatibility is essential until all references are updated
- The `.docker/` directory approach is a standard practice in many projects

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't break existing development workflows during migration
- Don't update all references before establishing backward compatibility
- Don't forget to test CI/CD pipelines after each change
- Don't remove compatibility measures before validating all references updated

### Resources
- Completed docker-linting-separation project in `roadmap/complete/`
- Current Makefile targets for Docker operations
- Existing CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Layout rules in `.ai/layout.yaml`

## 🎯 Definition of Done

The Docker reorganization is considered complete when:
- ✅ All Docker files organized in `.docker/` directory structure
- ✅ All Dockerfiles in appropriate subdirectories by type
- ✅ All compose files in `.docker/compose/` with clear names
- ✅ All Makefile targets updated to use new paths
- ✅ All CI/CD workflows updated and passing
- ✅ All documentation updated to reflect new structure
- ✅ Development workflow unchanged for developers
- ✅ Zero regression in Docker functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Successful end-to-end testing completed
