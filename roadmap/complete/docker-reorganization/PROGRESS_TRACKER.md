## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach
1. **Foundation (PR1)**: Create structure without disruption
2. **Migration (PR2-3)**: Move files with backward compatibility
3. **Integration (PR4)**: Update all references and remove compatibility
4. **Finalization (PR5)**: Documentation and validation

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Use symbolic links during migration phases
- Keep old paths working until all references updated
- Test extensively before removing compatibility measures

### Risk Mitigation
- Test all Docker operations after each PR
- Maintain CI/CD pipeline functionality throughout
- Document rollback procedures for each phase
- Validate development workflow at each step

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Directory Organization**: All Docker files in logical locations
- **Path Consistency**: All references use new structure
- **Functionality**: Zero regression in Docker operations
- **CI/CD Performance**: No negative impact on pipeline speed

### Quality Metrics
- **Developer Experience**: Easier to find and manage Docker files
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns achieved
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for new structure
- **Team Onboarding**: Simplified Docker setup documentation

## 🔄 Update Protocol

After completing each PR:
1. Update the PR status to 🟢 Complete
2. Fill in completion percentage
3. Add any important notes or blockers
4. Update the "Next PR to Implement" section
5. Update overall progress percentage
6. Test that development workflow still works
7. Commit changes to the progress document

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- This reorganization builds on the completed Docker linting separation project
- All existing Docker functionality must be preserved throughout migration
- Backward compatibility is essential until all references are updated
- The `.docker/` directory approach is a standard practice in many projects

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't break existing development workflows during migration
- Don't update all references before establishing backward compatibility
- Don't forget to test CI/CD pipelines after each change
- Don't remove compatibility measures before validating all references updated

### Resources
- Completed docker-linting-separation project in `roadmap/complete/`
- Current Makefile targets for Docker operations
- Existing CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Layout rules in `.ai/layout.yaml`

## 🎯 Definition of Done

The Docker reorganization is considered complete when:
- ✅ All Docker files organized in `.docker/` directory structure
- ✅ All Dockerfiles in appropriate subdirectories by type
- ✅ All compose files in `.docker/compose/` with clear names
- ✅ All Makefile targets updated to use new paths
- ✅ All CI/CD workflows updated and passing
- ✅ All documentation updated to reflect new structure
- ✅ Development workflow unchanged for developers
- ✅ Zero regression in Docker functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Successful end-to-end testing completed
