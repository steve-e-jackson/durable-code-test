Purpose: Unit tests for the file header validation linting rule
Scope: Testing header field detection, validation, and quality checks across file types
Overview: This comprehensive test suite validates the FileHeaderRule implementation, ensuring
    it correctly identifies missing headers, validates required fields, checks content quality,
    and supports multiple file types. Tests cover Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, YAML,
    and Markdown files with various header formats. The suite verifies field parsing logic,
    multi-line field handling, Overview word count validation, and proper error reporting.
    It also tests edge cases like files without headers, headers with placeholder text, and
    files that should be skipped. The tests ensure the rule provides helpful suggestions and
    maintains consistent behavior across all supported file types.
Dependencies: pytest, ast, pathlib, design_linters framework
