"""
Purpose: Validates FastAPI application through integration testing

Scope: Full API integration testing with database connectivity verification

Overview: Comprehensive integration test suite that validates the FastAPI application's core functionality
    including endpoint accessibility, health checks, database connectivity, and proper environment
    configuration setup for CI/CD pipeline execution and deployment verification. Tests ensure end-to-end
    functionality across application layers, verify database integration, validate API response formats,
    and confirm proper application behavior in CI/CD environments. The suite provides confidence in
    deployment readiness and system integration.

Dependencies: pytest, FastAPI test client, pathlib, os for environment variables

Exports: Integration test functions for API endpoints and database connectivity

Interfaces: pytest test functions with standard test patterns and CI environment checks

Implementation: Uses FastAPI TestClient with environment-based test skipping for CI integration
