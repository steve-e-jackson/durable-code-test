# Purpose: Python package dependencies for integration testing infrastructure
# Scope: Playwright-based browser automation and async testing framework requirements
# Overview: Defines the Python package dependencies required for running comprehensive
#     integration tests using Playwright for browser automation, async testing support
#     with pytest-asyncio, and WebSocket testing capabilities. These dependencies enable
#     end-to-end testing of the full application stack including frontend interactions,
#     real-time data streaming validation, and cross-service communication testing.
# Dependencies: Python package manager (pip) for installation and dependency resolution
# Exports: Package requirements specification for integration testing environment setup
# Environment: Testing environments requiring browser automation and async test execution
# Related: Dockerfile.playwright for containerized test execution and CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Implementation: Standard pip requirements format with version constraints for stability

# Integration test requirements
