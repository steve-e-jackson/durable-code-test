# How to Manage Terraform Deployment Scopes

## Overview
The infrastructure supports conditional deployment based on deployment scope, allowing you to manage base (persistent) and runtime (ephemeral) resources independently using native Terraform conditionals.

## Deployment Scopes

### Base Resources (Persistent, Expensive)
Deploy only persistent, expensive-to-recreate resources:
- VPC and networking infrastructure
- NAT Gateways (most expensive component ~$45/month)
- ECR repositories
- Route53 hosted zones
- ACM certificates
- Application Load Balancer

### Runtime Resources (Ephemeral, Quick)
Deploy only ephemeral, quick-to-recreate resources:
- ECS cluster and services
- Task definitions
- ALB listeners and target groups
- Service discovery
- CloudWatch log groups
- Route53 A records pointing to ALB

### All Resources (Default)
Deploy everything - both base and runtime resources.

## Common Operations

### Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
# Deploy only base infrastructure
make infra-up SCOPE=base

# Deploy only runtime infrastructure (assumes base exists)
make infra-up SCOPE=runtime

# Deploy everything (default)
make infra-up
make infra-up SCOPE=all
```

### Destroy Infrastructure

```bash
# Destroy only runtime (preserves base)
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime

# Destroy only base (requires confirmation)
make infra-down SCOPE=base CONFIRM=destroy-base

# Destroy everything (requires confirmation)
make infra-down SCOPE=all CONFIRM=destroy-all
```

### Plan Changes

Always plan before applying to understand what will be changed:

```bash
# Plan base resources only
make infra-plan SCOPE=base

# Plan runtime resources only
make infra-plan SCOPE=runtime

# Plan all resources
make infra-plan SCOPE=all
```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Daily Cost Savings Workflow

1. **End of Day - Shutdown Runtime**:
   ```bash
   make infra-down SCOPE=runtime
   ```
   Destroys ECS services, listeners, etc. while preserving NAT Gateway and certificates.

2. **Start of Day - Startup Runtime**:
   ```bash
   make infra-up SCOPE=runtime
   ```
   Recreates all runtime resources in ~5 minutes.

### Cost Impact
- NAT Gateway (base): ~$45/month if running 24/7
- Runtime resources: ~$10-15/month if running 24/7
- **Savings: ~66% on runtime costs with daily shutdown**

## Migration from Previous Infrastructure

If you have existing infrastructure created before the conditional deployment feature:

1. **Take a backup of your state**:
   ```bash
   terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate.backup
   ```

2. **Plan with `SCOPE=all`** to see the changes:
   ```bash
   make infra-plan SCOPE=all
   ```

3. **Apply with `SCOPE=all`** to update resource indexing:
   ```bash
   make infra-up SCOPE=all
   ```

The resources will be updated in place to use the new indexing scheme.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "index [0] is out of range"
This means you're trying to reference a resource that doesn't exist in the current scope.
- Check your deployment scope matches what you expect
- Ensure base resources exist before deploying runtime-only

### Error: "Resource not found"
Runtime resources depend on base resources.
```bash
# Ensure base infrastructure is deployed first
make infra-up SCOPE=base
```

### State Issues
If you encounter state inconsistencies:
```bash
# Refresh the state
make infra-refresh

# Check current resources
make infra-state-list

# As last resort, reinitialize
make infra-reinit
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always plan before applying** to understand changes
2. **Deploy base first** when starting fresh
3. **Use cost optimization** by destroying runtime when not needed
4. **Keep base resources minimal** to reduce always-on costs
5. **Document your deployment schedule** for team awareness
6. **Use the appropriate scope** for your current task
