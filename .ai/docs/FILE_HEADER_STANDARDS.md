## Overview

This document establishes unified header standards for all file types in the repository, providing consistent documentation patterns across markdown, configuration files, code files, and all other document types. The goal is to ensure every file is self-documenting with proper line breaks for readability and consistent formatting, while focusing on essential operational information that Git doesn't already track.

## Atemporal Documentation Principle

File headers must be written in an atemporal manner - avoiding language that references specific points in time, historical changes, or future plans. This ensures documentation remains accurate and relevant without requiring updates when circumstances change.

### Avoid These Temporal Patterns

**Explicit Timestamps:**
- ❌ "Created: 2025-09-12"
- ❌ "Updated: 2025-09-16"
- ❌ "Last modified: September 2025"

**State Change Language:**
- ❌ "This replaces the old implementation"
- ❌ "Changed from X to Y"
- ❌ "New implementation of..."
- ❌ "Formerly known as..."
- ❌ "Migrated from the legacy system"

**Temporal Qualifiers:**
- ❌ "Currently supports..."
- ❌ "Now includes..."
- ❌ "Recently added..."
- ❌ "Previously used for..."
- ❌ "Temporarily disabled"
- ❌ "For now, this handles..."

**Future References:**
- ❌ "Will be implemented"
- ❌ "Planned features include..."
- ❌ "To be added later"
- ❌ "Future improvements"

### Write Instead

**Present-tense, factual descriptions:**
- ✅ "Handles user authentication"
- ✅ "Provides data validation"
- ✅ "Implements the circuit breaker pattern"
- ✅ "Manages WebSocket connections"

**Feature descriptions without temporal context:**
- ✅ "Supports JSON and XML formats"
- ✅ "Includes error handling and retry logic"
- ✅ "Provides type-safe API interfaces"

**Capability statements:**
- ✅ "Validates input according to business rules"
- ✅ "Exports reusable UI components"
- ✅ "Integrates with the authentication service"

## Standard Header Formats

## Line Break and Formatting Guidelines

### Universal Readability Rules

1. **Double Line Breaks**: Use between major sections and header fields for visual separation
2. **Single Line Breaks**: Use within multi-line field descriptions for natural reading flow
3. **Consistent Indentation**: Maintain proper indentation for continuation lines
4. **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible for readability across different viewers

### File-Type Specific Formatting

#### Markdown Documents
- **Double line breaks**: After each header field (Purpose, Scope, etc.)
- **Horizontal rule (---)**: Separates header from main content
- **Consistent spacing**: Maintains readability across different markdown viewers
- **Natural flow**: Single line breaks within field descriptions for easy reading

#### Code File Comments (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript)
- **Blank lines**: Between field sections within comment blocks for visual organization
- **Consistent indentation**: Maintain language-appropriate comment formatting
- **Multi-line descriptions**: Use proper continuation indentation for readability

#### Configuration Files (YAML, Terraform, Docker)
- **Line continuation**: Use proper indentation with continuation characters for multi-line descriptions
- **Visual alignment**: Align continuation lines for consistent formatting
- **Comment spacing**: Single space after comment character (#) and field colon (:)

#### Example of Proper Line Breaks in Markdown:
```markdown
# Document Title

**Purpose**: Clear, concise description of what this document covers

**Scope**: What areas/components this document applies to

---

## Overview

Document content begins here with proper spacing...
```

#### Example of Proper Line Breaks in Python:
```python
"""
Purpose: Brief description of module functionality

Scope: What this module handles in the system

Overview: Comprehensive explanation of the module's role and responsibilities.
    Multi-line descriptions use proper indentation for continuation lines
    and maintain readability across different development environments.

Dependencies: Key external dependencies or internal modules required

Exports: Main classes, functions, or constants this module provides
"""
```

## Required Header Fields

### Mandatory Fields (All Files)
- **Purpose**: Brief description of file's functionality (1-2 lines)
  - What does this file do?
  - What is its primary responsibility?
- **Scope**: What areas/components this file covers or affects (1-2 lines)
- **Overview**: Comprehensive summary explaining the file's role and operation
  - How does it contribute to the system?
  - What are its key responsibilities and workflows?
  - How does it fit into the larger architecture?
  - Should be sufficient to understand the file without reading code

### Code Files Additional Fields (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript)
- **Dependencies**: Key dependencies, libraries, or related files
- **Exports**: Main classes, functions, components, or constants this file provides
- **Interfaces/Props**: Key APIs, interfaces, or props this file exposes or accepts

### Recommended Fields (Code Files)
- **Implementation**: Notable algorithms, patterns, or architectural decisions
- **State/Behavior**: Important state management or behavioral patterns used
- **Notes**: Any special considerations, warnings, or important operational details

### Optional Fields (All Files)
- **Related**: Links to related files, documentation, or external resources
- **Configuration**: Environment variables or config this file uses

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Header Placement
- **Markdown**: Header immediately after the main title
- **Code files**: Header as the first comment block (after shebang if present)
- **HTML**: Header in HTML comment after DOCTYPE
- **Configuration**: Header as comment at top of file

### 2. Content Guidelines
- Keep Purpose field concise but descriptive (1-3 sentences)
- Focus on operational details: what the file does and how it works
- Include key dependencies that aren't obvious from imports
- Mention any special considerations or operational notes
- **Use atemporal language**: Describe current capabilities without referencing time or changes

### 3. Automated Validation
The header linter tool validates:
- Presence of mandatory Purpose field
- Header structure and placement
- Field completeness and format
- Consistent formatting across file types
- Absence of temporal language patterns (dates, "currently", "now", "replaces", etc.)

## Examples

### Good Header Example (Python Linter)
```python
"""
Purpose: Validates file placement according to project structure standards
Scope: Project-wide file organization enforcement across all directories
Overview: This linter analyzes Python, HTML, TypeScript, and configuration files to ensure
    they are located in appropriate directories as defined in STANDARDS.md. It enforces
    project organization rules by checking files against configurable placement rules,
    detecting violations, and providing suggested corrections. The linter supports multiple
    file types and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to maintain consistent project structure.
Dependencies: pathlib for file operations, fnmatch for pattern matching, argparse for CLI interface
Exports: FilePlacementLinter class, ViolationType enum, PlacementRule dataclass
Interfaces: main() CLI function, analyze_project() returns List[FilePlacementViolation]
Implementation: Uses rule-based pattern matching with configurable directory allowlists/blocklists
"""
```

### Good Header Example (React Component)
```typescript
/**
 * Purpose: Reusable loading spinner component with customizable styling
 * Scope: UI components across the application for async state management
 * Overview: Displays animated spinner during async operations and data fetching with full
 *     accessibility support. Provides multiple size variants and color themes that integrate
 *     with the design system. Handles loading states for API calls, file uploads, and other
 *     asynchronous operations. Includes proper ARIA labeling and reduced motion support for
 *     accessibility compliance.
 * Dependencies: React, CSS modules for styling, clsx for conditional classes
 * Exports: LoadingSpinner component as default export
 * Props/Interfaces: LoadingSpinnerProps { size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg', color?: string, label?: string }
 * State/Behavior: No internal state, purely presentational component with CSS animations
 */
```

### Good Header Example (API Service)
```typescript
/**
 * Purpose: Handles all HTTP requests to the backend API with authentication
 * Scope: Frontend API integration layer, used by all components needing backend data
 * Overview: Provides typed interfaces for user management, data fetching, and file uploads.
 *     Implements automatic authentication token handling, request/response interceptors,
 *     error normalization, and retry logic for failed requests. Centralizes all backend
 *     communication to ensure consistent error handling, loading states, and data formatting
 *     across the application. Supports file uploads with progress tracking and CRUD operations
 *     for all major entities.
 * Dependencies: axios for HTTP requests, jwt-decode for token handling, custom types from @/types
 * Exports: ApiService class, apiClient instance, ApiError class, RequestConfig type
 * Interfaces: CRUD operations for User, Project, File entities; uploadFile(), downloadFile()
 * Implementation: Uses axios interceptors for auth tokens, implements retry logic and error normalization
 */
```

### Good Header Example (Markdown)
```markdown
# API Documentation Standards

**Purpose**: Define REST API documentation requirements and standards for consistent API docs across all backend services
**Scope**: All API endpoints in the backend application

---
```

### Bad Header Example
```python
"""
This file does stuff with files.
"""
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Update Existing Files
1. Add headers to all existing documentation files in `/docs`
2. Update core Python files in `/tools` and `/durable-code-app/backend`
3. Update key TypeScript files in `/durable-code-app/frontend/src`
4. Ensure all mandatory Purpose fields are present and descriptive

### Phase 2: Implement Enhanced Linter
1. Create automated header validation tool
2. Integrate into pre-commit hooks
3. Add to CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 3: Enforce Standards
1. Make header linter blocking in CI/CD
2. Update contribution guidelines
3. Train team on new standards

## Tools and Automation

### Header Linter
- Location: `/tools/design_linters/header_linter.py` (to be created)
- Usage: `python tools/design_linters/header_linter.py --path .`
- Validates: Purpose field presence, header structure, formatting
- Exit codes: 0 (pass), 1 (warnings), 2 (failures)

### Pre-commit Integration
```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: header-check
      name: Check file headers
      entry: python tools/design_linters/header_linter.py
      language: system
      files: \.(md|py|ts|tsx|js|jsx|html|yml|yaml)$
```

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Easy to understand what each file does and how it operates
2. **Maintainability**: Clear operational descriptions help with maintenance
3. **Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand file purposes and dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Headers serve as minimal, always-current documentation
5. **Git Integration**: No redundant metadata that git already tracks

## Exceptions

Files that may not need headers:
- Auto-generated files (clearly marked as such)
- Very small configuration files (<10 lines)
- Template files used by generators
- Third-party files (should be clearly identified)
- Test fixture files that only contain data
