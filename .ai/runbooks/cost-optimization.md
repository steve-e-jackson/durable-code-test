## Automated Cost Optimization

### GitHub Actions Scheduling

The infrastructure includes automated workflows for cost optimization:

#### Nightly Runtime Teardown
- **Schedule**: 8 PM PST (weekdays only)
- **Action**: `make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev`
- **Savings**: ~$1.50/day (~$30/month)
- **Restoration**: Automatic at 8 AM PST

#### Weekend Extended Shutdown
- **Schedule**: Friday 8 PM PST
- **Action**: `make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=dev` (with confirmation)
- **Savings**: ~$3.50/day (~$7/weekend)
- **Restoration**: Monday 8 AM PST

#### Automation Commands
```bash
# Check automation status
gh workflow list --repo your-org/durable-code-test

# View recent automation runs
gh run list --workflow=nightly-teardown

# Manual trigger automation
gh workflow run nightly-teardown --field environment=dev
gh workflow run morning-startup --field environment=dev
```

## Manual Cost Optimization Procedures

### Daily Optimization Workflow

#### End-of-Day Shutdown (Manual)
```bash
# Step 1: Verify no active development
echo "Checking for active sessions..."
make infra-status ENV=dev

# Step 2: Safe runtime shutdown
echo "Shutting down runtime infrastructure..."
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev

# Step 3: Verify shutdown success
echo "Verifying shutdown..."
make infra-status ENV=dev
# Should show: Base=UP, Runtime=DOWN
```

#### Start-of-Day Restoration (Manual)
```bash
# Step 1: Restore runtime infrastructure
echo "Restoring runtime infrastructure..."
make infra-up SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev

# Step 2: Deploy latest application version
echo "Deploying application..."
make deploy ENV=dev

# Step 3: Verify service health
echo "Verifying deployment..."
make infra-status ENV=dev
curl -f http://your-app-url/health || echo "Application not ready yet"
```

### Weekly Optimization Workflow

#### Extended Weekend Shutdown
```bash
# Friday evening (after 5 PM)
echo "=== Weekend Shutdown Procedure ==="

# Step 1: Notify team
echo "📢 NOTICE: Starting weekend infrastructure shutdown"

# Step 2: Destroy all infrastructure
echo "Destroying all infrastructure..."
CONFIRM=destroy-base make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=dev

# Step 3: Verify complete shutdown
make infra-status ENV=dev
# Should show: Base=DOWN, Runtime=DOWN

echo "✅ Weekend shutdown complete. Savings: ~$7"
```

#### Monday Morning Restoration
```bash
# Monday morning (before 9 AM)
echo "=== Weekend Restoration Procedure ==="

# Step 1: Restore all infrastructure
echo "Restoring complete infrastructure..."
make infra-up SCOPE=all ENV=dev

# Step 2: Deploy application
echo "Deploying application..."
make deploy ENV=dev

# Step 3: Verify full service
echo "Verifying complete restoration..."
make infra-status ENV=dev
curl -f http://your-app-url/health

echo "✅ Weekend restoration complete. Service ready."
```

## Emergency Cost Reduction

### Immediate Cost Reduction (Emergency)
```bash
# EMERGENCY: Immediate shutdown of all non-production environments
echo "🚨 EMERGENCY COST REDUCTION PROTOCOL"

# Shutdown development
CONFIRM=destroy-base make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=dev

# Shutdown staging (if safe)
CONFIRM=destroy-base make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=staging

# Production: Runtime only (if absolutely necessary)
# make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=prod  # ⚠️ USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION

echo "✅ Emergency shutdown complete"
```

### Gradual Cost Reduction
```bash
# Step 1: Runtime only shutdown (preserves quick restoration)
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=staging

# Step 2: If more savings needed, full shutdown
CONFIRM=destroy-base make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=dev
CONFIRM=destroy-base make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=staging

# Step 3: Monitor cost impact
echo "Monitor AWS Cost Explorer for 24-48 hours"
```

## Cost Monitoring Procedures

### Daily Cost Monitoring
```bash
# Check infrastructure status
make infra-status ENV=dev
make infra-status ENV=staging
make infra-status ENV=prod

# Verify automation working
gh run list --workflow=nightly-teardown --limit=5

# Quick cost estimate
echo "Expected daily costs:"
echo "- Dev (runtime down): ~$1.50/day"
echo "- Staging (runtime up): ~$3.50/day"
echo "- Prod (always up): ~$3.50/day"
```

### Weekly Cost Review
```bash
# Generate cost report (requires AWS CLI with Cost Explorer access)
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-01-08 \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE

# Manual verification via AWS Console
echo "📊 Review AWS Cost Explorer: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-reports/"
```

### Monthly Cost Analysis
```bash
# Infrastructure cost summary
echo "=== Monthly Infrastructure Cost Analysis ==="
echo "Target costs with optimization:"
echo "- Development: ~$15/month (75% savings)"
echo "- Staging: ~$50/month (50% savings)"
echo "- Production: ~$105/month (0% savings)"
echo "- Total Target: ~$170/month vs ~$315 without optimization"
echo "- Monthly Savings: ~$145 (46%)"
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies by Environment

### Development Environment
```bash
# Aggressive optimization strategy
# - Nightly shutdown: 8 PM - 8 AM (12 hours down)
# - Weekend shutdown: Friday 8 PM - Monday 8 AM (60 hours down)
# - Holiday shutdown: Complete teardown during holidays

# Commands for dev optimization
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev     # Nightly
CONFIRM=destroy-base make infra-down SCOPE=all ENV=dev  # Weekend/Holiday
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
# Moderate optimization strategy
# - Selective shutdown: Non-business hours
# - Preserve during active testing periods
# - Weekend runtime shutdown only

# Commands for staging optimization
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=staging  # Off-hours only
# Keep base infrastructure always up for quick testing
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Minimal optimization strategy
# - No automated shutdowns
# - Manual optimization only during planned maintenance
# - Focus on right-sizing rather than shutdown

# Production cost optimization (rare)
# make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=prod  # ONLY during planned maintenance
```

## Automation Configuration

### GitHub Actions Secrets Required
```bash
# Required secrets for automation
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-west-2

# Verify secrets configured
gh secret list --repo your-org/durable-code-test
```

### Automation Schedule Override
```bash
# Disable automation temporarily
gh workflow disable nightly-teardown
gh workflow disable morning-startup

# Re-enable automation
gh workflow enable nightly-teardown
gh workflow enable morning-startup

# Manual override during automation downtime
# Run manual procedures from sections above
```

## Cost Optimization Best Practices

### Operational Practices
1. **Monitor daily costs** through AWS Cost Explorer
2. **Verify automation success** each morning
3. **Communicate shutdowns** to development team
4. **Plan around holidays** for extended savings
5. **Right-size resources** based on actual usage

### Safety Practices
1. **Never shutdown production** without explicit planning
2. **Test restoration procedures** regularly
3. **Backup critical data** before major shutdowns
4. **Maintain emergency contact lists** for off-hours issues
5. **Document cost optimization schedules** for team awareness

### Financial Practices
1. **Track cost savings** monthly
2. **Report optimization metrics** to stakeholders
3. **Budget for infrastructure costs** with optimization assumptions
4. **Review cost alerts** and thresholds regularly
5. **Plan capacity** based on optimized costs

## Troubleshooting Cost Issues

### High Unexpected Costs
```bash
# Check if automation failed
gh run list --workflow=nightly-teardown --status=failure

# Verify infrastructure status
make infra-status ENV=dev
make infra-status ENV=staging

# Emergency shutdown if needed
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=staging
```

### Automation Failures
```bash
# Check automation logs
gh run view --log [run-id]

# Manual recovery
make infra-down SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev  # If shutdown failed
make infra-up SCOPE=runtime ENV=dev    # If startup failed

# Verify AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Cost Optimization Not Working
```bash
# Verify workspace separation working
make infra-status ENV=dev

# Check AWS resource tags
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Environment,Values=dev"
aws ecs list-clusters --query 'clusterArns[?contains(@, `dev`)]'

# Validate cost allocation
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-01-02 --granularity DAILY --metrics BlendedCost --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
```

## Emergency Contacts and Escalation

### Cost Emergency Response
1. **Immediate Action**: Execute emergency cost reduction procedures
2. **Notification**: Alert team via communication channels
3. **Monitoring**: Watch AWS Cost Explorer for 24-48 hours
4. **Review**: Conduct post-incident review of cost spike

### Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1**: Development team (cost optimization procedures)
- **Level 2**: DevOps team (infrastructure investigation)
- **Level 3**: Management (budget variance reporting)
- **Level 4**: Finance team (cost containment measures)
